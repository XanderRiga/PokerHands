# PokerHands

## Dependencies
Enumerations:

pip install enum34

## How it works:
In the main method there are a few test cases. the cards in those test cases can be modified and the code can be run. 
The winner of each hand will be output to the console. There is a basic poker hand for player A and B at the top. This
will run those 2 hands directly against each other and tell you the winner. Below that there is a texas hold'em style game.
The table is a set of 5 cards in a hand that can be changed, and each players hand can be changed, it will then give you
each player's hand and who won
